  Process Reimagination and Systems Implementation            AA: Angela Lorenzen OW: Lindsay Grant   CMS paths forward           Wipro has been informed that it has been selected as the vendor for Phase 0. The vendor requires 4--6 weeks to onboard its team, so the exact Phase 0 start date is still pending confirmation Internally, AA is defining Phase 0 outcomes. Once that is complete, a collaborative session with Wipro can be held to align on the Phase 0 approach, outcomes, and timelines
                                                                                                      First-movers acceleration   Takeoff performance & load planning Targeted go‑live timeline has been pushed to 2028, and vendor selection timeline has been moved from January 16 to a TBD date before the end of Q1 2026  PoT for the takeoff performance system with Smart4Aviation and the OE team was held on January 21; a session to gather OE's feedback is scheduled for January 27 An additional session with Smart4Aviation to continue diligencing non‑functional requirements was held on January 22 A review session with the LPS team was conducted on January 22 to incorporate their insights into the vendor selection process Crew Pay Crew Comp and NXOP teams kicked off interviews and documentation for crew compensation sub‑capabilities to build initial materials for vendor requirements discussions As part of the documentation process, two templates will be shared with Skymetrix to gather early vendor input and ensure the team's documentation efforts are focused in the right areas MYA submission is with Finance and currently under review.Vendor-side items remain open, including pricing questions and MSA redlines. Cybersecurity assessment is complete; Privacy assessment is in progress

  FXIP phased cutover:  Initially proposed phased cutover plans have been iterated on by AA's FXIP product team; The core working team is directionally aligned on the iterated proposal, enabling a more direct path to finalized cutover approach before "dress-rehearsals" start ASM development:  ASM development team is on track to build out GraphQL services by end of January, enabling the completion of ASM development in the NXOP dev environment; AA networking team is actively working to connect to FAA data feeds to reinforce real-time ADL data for ASM Knowledge transfer:  Three knowledge transfer sessions between engineering teams involved in NXOP development and offshore resources have been conducted to provide all engineering resources full context on development of the platform to date Hybrid DNS pattern for NXOP:  The DDI team met internally to discuss the development timeline associated with a hybrid DNS pattern for NXOP and agreed that an initial solution will be available by 1/23, further enabling initial production go-lives (FXIP and ASM)  Crew Pay:  Started work with CrewPay defining data source requirements and NXOP responsibilities

  FXIP development:  Reassessment of timeline for FXIP testing is expected by 1/15, primarily driven by infrastructure that still needs to be established between NXOP and Ops Hub to enable testing of the application (e.g., consumer and producer endpoints); Change request will be submitted accordingly FXIP phased cutover:  Proposed phased cutover approach has been shared with AA's FXIP team and is currently undergoing their review to align on a single plan by 1/16; Once approach is selected, cutover will be simulated via a "dress rehearsal" to ensure cutover readiness ASM development:  ASM development team is on track to build out GraphQL services by end of January, enabling the completion of ASM development in the NXOP dev environment Full non-prod environment:  Demonstration and handover session for the full non-prod environment has been scheduled for 1/21 to socialize functional and non-functional testing capabilities supported by the environment with NXOP developers MSK authentication mechanism:  OIDC has been selected as the preferred approach for IAM roles on NXOP,  entrusting  secure identities with temporary access to NXOP\'s cloud resources Observability for NXOP:  Application metrics to be published into CloudWatch are currently being defined to ensure impactful observability patterns

  Develop ASM  GraphQL  services in Dev          On track   Chai Kommidi   1/30                Services are actively being developed, with two potential, unrealized risks   The two risks are not yet material, but are worth raising to avoid putting the deliverable at risk: A dedicated feed between AA networking and FAA has not been established yet A dedicated feed between FAA and ADL has not been established yet   AA networking team has been asked to set up correct infrastructure with FAA data feeds to prevent material risk to ASM development
