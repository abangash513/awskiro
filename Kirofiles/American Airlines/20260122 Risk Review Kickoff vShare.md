Recap | Risk matrix
The agreed upon risk framework is embedded in tooling to ensure consistent evaluation of risks



           A framework was aligned on last quarter to classify risks by                              This classification is reflected in the tooling and used to

      interactions and future requirements; input issue/risk in tooling and assign owner and potential target closure date; articulate next steps
